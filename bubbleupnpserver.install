Before starting BubbleUPnP Server, have a look at the default config
file located at /etc/default/bubbleupnpserver and make sure the defaults
are OK.

To start BubbleUPnP, you must first enable the service unit file:
# systemctl enable bubbleupnpserver

Then start the service:
# systemctl start bubbleupnpserver

To complete the configuration once the service has been started, point
your web browser to http://localhost:58050 or https://localhost:58051
